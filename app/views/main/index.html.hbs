      <span class="list-header">Engineering Expertise</span>
      We have written the internals of some of the most popular NoSQL software, including HBase.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="list-header">Operational Expertise</span>
      We were the first to build operational runbooks for NoSQL databases in live-critical production environments, including HBase and Cassandra. We were key players of these distributed database systems in their first major critical production rollouts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="list-header">Monitoring Expertise</span>
      We have always been responsible for producing human-interpretable statistics from the trending and alerting packages that watch the databases. Our job is to present the status of the cluster in a way that the management can understand.

    We have been helping shape the roles of NoSQL distributed databases at the biggest organisations on the internet for years. Google. Amazon. Mozilla. Obama for America. Whatever your needs, we can help.
