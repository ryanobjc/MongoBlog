      <h2>Engineering Expertise</h2>
      <p class="lead">We have written the internals of some of the most popular NoSQL software, including HBase.</p>

      <h2>Operational Expertise</h2>
      <p class="lead">We were the first to operate and build runbooks for NoSQL
      databases in live-critical production environments, including
      HBase and Cassandra. We were key players of these distributed
      database systems in their first major critical production
      rollouts.</p>

      <h2>Monitoring Expertise</h2>
      <p class="lead">We have always been responsible for producing
      human-interpretable statistics from the trending and alerting
      packages that watch the databases. Our job is to present the
      status of the cluster in a way that the management can
      understand.</p>
